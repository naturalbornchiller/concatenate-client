    <p><strong>Concatenate</strong> is an app designed to display progress. The concept is simple. Users create tasks to track. After completing the task, and adding to the chain (a visual representation of the number of days in a row a task has been completed), a user is able to view the fruits of repitition and incremental growth.</p>
    <p>Don&lsquo;t break the chain!</p>
